# network_mitm

Nintendo Switch Network MITM sysmodule.

network_mitm allows you to:
- Dump traffic from SSL of the running game (NEX,...) in PCAP files.
- Mitm ssl to replace `NintendoClass2CAG3` CA with a user provided one (useful for NPLN traffic capture).

More features might appears depending of the needs.

## Configuration
The following configuration should be added to `/atmosphere/config/system_settings.ini`:

```ini
; network_mitm config
[network_mitm]
; Enable SSL: This should be set to 1 for certificate swapping, and also for PCAP capturing.
enable_ssl = u8!0x1
; Uncomment this line to enable mitm of everything (including system titles).
; should_mitm_all = u8!0x1
; Uncomment this line to disable SSL verifications (DANGEROUS)
; should_disable_ssl_verification = u8!0x1
; Root CA filename: this should be present in the root of the SD (sd:/rootCA.pem for the below example)
custom_ca_public_cert = str!rootCA.pem
; By default, the sysmodule will dump decrypted network traffic user-link PCAPs to the SD card only for the main application.
; Uncomment this line to disable.
; should_dump_ssl_traffic = u8!0x0
; Possible values "ethernet", "ip" or "user"
; pcap_link_type = str!user
```
